Initial commit. 

commit from visual studio for the assignment.

modifying from github.

was able to see the change I made on github from vs now I am resolving merge conflict.

Things I learned: I think it is really important to commit and pull as often as possible to avoide merge conflicts, especially when more than one person is working on the same project.
